## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for playing drum sounds and handling user interactions.

## Features

- **Play Drum Sounds**: Users can click on the drum buttons or press specific keys on their keyboard to play different drum sounds.
- **Button Animation**: When a drum button is pressed, it visually animates to indicate it has been activated.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Ensure all files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, and `index.js`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the project.

## Usage

- **Clicking Buttons**: Click on any of the drum buttons labeled "a", "s", "d", "f", "j", "k", or "l" to play the corresponding drum sound.
- **Pressing Keys**: Press the keys "a", "s", "d", "f", "j", "k", or "l" on your keyboard to play the corresponding drum sound.
